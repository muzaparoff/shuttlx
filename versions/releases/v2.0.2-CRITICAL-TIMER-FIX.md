# ShuttlX v2.0.2 - CRITICAL TIMER FIX + Apple Fitness UI

**Release Date**: June 13, 2025  
**Build Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - Critical MVP show-stopper resolved  
**Priority**: 🚨 **CRITICAL** - Fixes main app functionality

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL FIX: Timer Countdown Not Starting**

### **Issue**: 
The main MVP show-stopper - pressing "Start Training" on watchOS didn't start the countdown timer, making the app completely unusable for workouts.

### **Root Cause**:
Swift 6 actor isolation warnings were causing the timer callback to fail when trying to call `@MainActor` methods from a non-isolated context.

### **Solution**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Fixed actor isolation**: Wrapped timer callbacks in `Task { @MainActor in ... }` 
- **Added backup timer mechanism**: Secondary timer trigger after 0.5s to ensure startup
- **Enhanced UI updates**: Multiple `objectWillChange.send()` calls with async dispatch
- **Comprehensive logging**: Added detailed timer state tracking for debugging

**Result**: Timer now starts immediately and counts down reliably ⏱️

## 🎨 **Apple Fitness-Style UI Redesign**

### **Issue**: 
watchOS workout screen was cluttered with controls that didn't fit properly, making it hard to focus on the timer.

### **Solution**: ✅ **APPLE FITNESS DESIGN**
Redesigned workout view with clean tabbed interface:

#### **Tab 1: Timer Focus (Like Apple Fitness)** 
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│        ● Walk       │ ← Activity indicator
│                     │
│      05:00          │ ← Large timer (48pt)
│                     │
│   Interval 1 of 10  │ ← Progress
│                     │
│ ← Swipe for controls│ ← Hint
└─────────────────────┘
```

#### **Tab 2: Controls & Metrics**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ HR  │ CAL │TIME│PACE│ ← 2x2 metrics
│ 142 │ 45  │2:30│5.2 │
│                     │
│   [Pause/Resume]    │ ← Primary action
│                     │
│ [Skip] [End]        │ ← Secondary actions  
│                     │
│ Swipe for timer →   │ ← Hint
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits**:
- **Clean timer focus** - No distractions during workout
