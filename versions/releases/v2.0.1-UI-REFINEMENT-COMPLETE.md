# ShuttlX v2.0.1 - watchOS UI Refinement & Test Organization

**Release Date**: June 13, 2025  
**Build Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - Both iOS and watchOS platforms build successfully

---

## 🎯 Bug Fixes Completed

### **Issue #1: watchOS "Start Training" Button Layout**
**Problem**: After removing scrolling, the "Start training" button didn't fit the screen properly due to program information taking up too much space.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ **Refactored TrainingDetailView_Simple.swift** to show only program name and centered "Start Training" button
- ✅ **Removed program stats clutter** (difficulty badge, stats grid with walk/run/distance/calories)
- ✅ **Centered button layout** using proper VStack with Spacers for optimal watch screen utilization
- ✅ **Maintained consistent button sizing** (.frame(height: 44)) for all watch screen sizes

**Impact**: Clean, minimalist program detail view that focuses on the primary action - starting the workout.

---

### **Issue #2: Test File Organization & Integration**
**Problem**: Multiple timer test files scattered in project root, not properly integrated into build system.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Removed unused standalone files**: verify_timer_fix.swift, timer_live_debug.swift, simple_timer_test.swift
- ✅ **Deleted empty test file**: SimpleTimerTests.swift 
- ✅ **Enhanced build script** with run_swift_integration_tests() function to execute Swift tests via xcodebuild
- ✅ **Integrated test execution** into comprehensive test suite in build_and_test_both_platforms.sh
- ✅ **Fixed build script syntax** issues that were preventing proper test execution

**Impact**: Clean project structure with all tests properly organized and automated execution.
