# ShuttlX AI Agent Guide: Data Synchronization & Build Resolution

<!-- DO NOT DELETE THE RULES SECTION - CRITICAL PROJECT GUIDELINES -->
## 🚨 PROJECT RULES & GUIDELINES - DO NOT DELETE THIS SECTION

### Core Development Rules:
1. **No Duplicate Files**: Never create hundreds of backup files (project.pbxproj.backup_*, *.swift.backup, etc.)
2. **No Throwaway Scripts**: Do not create .py, .sh, or .md files that are used only once or never
3. **Preserve CI/CD**: NEVER delete `build_and_test_both_platforms.sh` - this is our main CI/CD script
4. **Always Test After Changes**: Run `./build_and_test_both_platforms.sh` after completing any feature
5. **Clean Test Organization**: All test files go in `/tests/` directory, not project root

### File Management:
- Keep project root clean - only essential project files
- Use `/tests/` for all test scripts, backup files, and development utilities
- Main build scripts stay in root (CI/CD requirement)
- No scattered backup files throughout the project

## 📱⌚ SYNC ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION

### Overview
ShuttlX uses a robust dual-sync architecture combining WatchConnectivity for real-time communication with App Groups for persistent shared storage, following Apple's recommended practices for iOS-watchOS data synchronization.

### Core Components

#### 1. SharedDataManager (Singleton Pattern)
**Location**: 
- iOS: `/ShuttlX/Services/SharedDataManager.swift`
- watchOS: `/ShuttlXWatch Watch App Watch App/Services/SharedDataManager.swift`

**Key Features**:
- Thread-safe singleton implementation
- Dual-sync mechanism (WatchConnectivity + App Groups)
- Real-time status monitoring and logging
- Automatic fallback handling

```swift
// Proper usage pattern
let manager = SharedDataManager.shared
```

#### 2. Dual-Sync Architecture

**A. WatchConnectivity (Real-time sync)**
- Used for immediate data transfer when both devices are active
- Handles session management and reachability
- Provides instant updates for active sessions

**B. App Groups (Persistent storage)**
- Shared container: `group.shuttlx.shared`
- Persistent storage for training programs and sessions
- Reliable fallback when WatchConnectivity is unavailable
- Automatic directory creation with fallback mechanism

### Sync Flow

#### Training Program Sync
1. **Save Operation**: Data saved to both App Group container and sent via WatchConnectivity
2. **Real-time Transfer**: Active sessions get immediate updates via WC
3. **Persistent Storage**: All data persists in shared App Group container
4. **Startup Sync**: Apps load from App Group on launch and sync any missing data

#### Session Data Sync
1. **Active Workout**: Real-time updates via WatchConnectivity
2. **Session Complete**: Full session data saved to App Group
3. **Cross-platform Access**: Both platforms can access complete session history

### Debug and Diagnostics

#### DebugView (watchOS)
**Location**: `/ShuttlXWatch Watch App Watch App/Views/DebugView.swift`

**Features**:
- Real-time sync status display
- WatchConnectivity session information
- App Group container status
- Sync operation logs
- Manual sync triggers

#### Diagnostic Scripts
- `test_create_program.swift`: Creates test training programs
- `test_sync_diagnosis.swift`: Verifies container access and data integrity

### Best Practices

#### 1. Singleton Usage
```swift
// ✅ Correct
let manager = SharedDataManager.shared

// ❌ Incorrect
let manager = SharedDataManager()
```

#### 2. Error Handling
- Always check App Group container availability
- Implement fallback mechanisms for sync failures
- Log sync operations for debugging

#### 3. Data Consistency
- Use App Groups as the source of truth
- WatchConnectivity for real-time updates only
- Validate data integrity after sync operations

#### 4. Testing Sync
```bash
# Build and install both platforms
./build_and_test_both_platforms.sh

# Create test data
swift test_create_program.swift

# Verify sync status
swift test_sync_diagnosis.swift
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**1. Sync Not Working**
- Verify App Group entitlements are properly configured
- Check WatchConnectivity session activation
- Review DebugView for connectivity status

**2. Data Not Persisting**
- Ensure App Group container directories exist
- Check SharedDataManager singleton usage
- Verify file permissions and access

**3. Missing Data on Platform**
- Trigger manual sync from DebugView
- Check App Group container contents
- Verify both apps are using same container ID

#### Debug Commands
```swift
// Check container status
SharedDataManager.shared.debugContainerStatus()

// Manual sync trigger
SharedDataManager.shared.syncAllData()

// View sync logs
// Available in DebugView on watchOS
```
