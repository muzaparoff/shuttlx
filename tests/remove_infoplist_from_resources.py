"""
Fix the duplicate Info.plist issue by specifically addressing the error:
"Multiple commands produce '/Users/sergey/Documents/github/shuttlx/build/Release-iphonesimulator/ShuttlXWatch Watch App Watch App.app/Info.plist'"

The issue is that the Info.plist is both being processed as an Info.plist file and included in the
Copy Bundle Resources phase. This script removes the null references in the resources phase that
are causing the duplicate Info.plist error.

This script was created as part of Phase 18 to fix the build issue preventing the iOS app from
building successfully. The specific error was:
  - error: Multiple commands produce '[path]/ShuttlXWatch Watch App Watch App.app/Info.plist'
  - note: Target has copy command from '[path]/Info.plist' 
  - note: Target has process command with output '[path]/Info.plist'

The fix works by:
1. Finding null resource references in the PBXBuildFile section
2. Identifying resources build phases that contain these null references
3. Removing the null references from the resources phase
4. Also removing the null build file entries from the project file

Usage:
    ./tests/remove_infoplist_from_resources.py

After running this script, the build should succeed without the duplicate Info.plist error.
