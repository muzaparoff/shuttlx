## 🔧 **RECENT FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS (v1.0.1)**

### **Default Program Synchronization Fix**
**ISSUE RESOLVED:** watchOS was showing different default training programs than iOS due to inconsistent sample data definitions.

**ROOT CAUSE:** The `WatchWorkoutManager.swift` fallback sample data had different interval durations and maxPulse values compared to `DataManager.swift` on iOS.

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
- Synchronized sample program definitions between iOS `DataManager.swift` and watchOS `WatchWorkoutManager.swift`
- Both platforms now show identical default programs:
  - "Beginner Walk-Run": 5 intervals, maxPulse 140
  - "Intermediate Walk-Run": 8 intervals, maxPulse 160
- Updated intervals to match exact durations and configurations

### **Device Pairing & Build Target Fix**
**ISSUE RESOLVED:** Apps were being built for iPhone 16 (iOS 18.5) but installed on iPhone paired to Apple Watch on iOS 18.4, causing version mismatches.

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
- Unpaired old device combinations
- Ensured both iPhone 16 (iOS 18.5) and Apple Watch Series 10 (watchOS 11.5) are properly paired
- Verified build script targets correct simulator versions
- Both apps now install and run on the correct paired devices

### **Troubleshooting Automated Tests**
- **XCUITest failures**: Script includes fallback manual verification
- **Simulator not found**: Script automatically starts required simulators
- **Timer verification**: Multiple verification methods implemented
- **Sync timeout**: Extended timeouts for automation environment
- **Device pairing issues**: Use `xcrun simctl list pairs` to verify correct device pairing
- **Different default programs**: Fixed in v1.0.1 - both platforms now show identical sample data

## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Default Programs Don't Match Between iOS and watchOS**
**FIXED IN v1.0.1** - Both platforms now show identical default programs immediately after install.

#### **Apps Install on Wrong Simulator Versions**
**SOLUTION:** Verify device pairing:
```bash
# Check current device pairs
xcrun simctl list pairs

# If needed, unpair old devices and re-pair correct versions
xcrun simctl unpair <OLD_PAIR_ID>
xcrun simctl pair <IPHONE_16_ID> <APPLE_WATCH_SERIES_10_ID>
```

#### **Build Targeting Wrong iOS/watchOS Versions**
**SOLUTION:** The build script is hardcoded to target:
- iPhone 16 with iOS 18.5
- Apple Watch Series 10 (46mm) with watchOS 11.5

If these simulators don't exist, install them via Xcode → Settings → Platforms.

#### **Sample Data Inconsistencies**
**FIXED IN v1.0.1** - Sample data synchronized between:
- `ShuttlX/Services/DataManager.swift` (iOS)
- `ShuttlXWatch Watch App/Services/WatchWorkoutManager.swift` (watchOS)

## 📁 **FILE MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Working with Clean Files Only**

To maintain a clean codebase and avoid build issues, **DO NOT** create or work with duplicate files that have these suffixes:
- `_new.swift` (e.g., `ContentView_New.swift`)
- `_clean.swift` (e.g., `UserModels_clean.swift`) 
- `_backup.swift` (e.g., `UserModels_backup.swift`)
- `.backup` files

**✅ CORRECT APPROACH:**
- Work only with the actual production files (e.g., `ContentView.swift`, `UserModels.swift`)
- If you need to make changes, edit the original file directly
- Use git for version control and backup, not duplicate files

**❌ INCORRECT APPROACH:**
- Creating `ContentView_New.swift` alongside `ContentView.swift`
- Keeping multiple versions like `UserModels.swift`, `UserModels_clean.swift`, `UserModels_backup.swift`
- Adding `.backup` extensions to files in the source tree

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
- Duplicate files can cause build conflicts and ambiguous type errors
- The build system may compile multiple versions of the same code
- It makes debugging and maintenance much more difficult
- The automated testing system expects a clean, single-source-of-truth structure

**EXISTING BACKUP LOCATION:**
- Historical versions and alternatives are stored in `versions/releases/v1.0-automated-testing/`
- This keeps them available for reference without affecting the build
