6. **‚úÖ Auto Completion:** Workout ends when distance goal reached  
7. **‚úÖ Data Sync Back:** Completed workout data appears in iOS app  

**BUILT-IN PROGRAM FLOW:**
1. **‚úÖ Launch:** Apple Watch Series 10 simulator opens ShuttlX  
2. **‚úÖ Navigate:** Choose from default programs (Beginner 5K, HIIT, etc.)  
3. **‚úÖ Start:** Press "Start Training" button  
4. **‚úÖ Timer Display:** Immediately shows proper interval duration  
5. **‚úÖ Countdown:** Timer updates every second with beautiful circular progress  

## ü§ñ **NEW: AUTOMATED TESTING SYSTEM**

### **Complete Automated Testing with --full Flag**
```bash
# Run complete automated testing workflow
./build_and_test_both_platforms.sh --full

# This automatically:
# 1. Builds both iOS and watchOS apps
# 2. Deploys to simulators (iPhone 16 + Apple Watch 10)
# 3. Creates "tests123" custom workout (10s intervals, 500m distance)
# 4. Verifies sync to watchOS within 3 seconds
# 5. Starts workout on watch and verifies timer counts down
# 6. Ends workout and verifies data syncs back to iOS
# 7. Generates comprehensive test report
```

### **XCUITest Automation Implemented**
- **iOS UI Tests**: `ShuttlXUITests/ShuttlXUITests.swift`
  - Automated custom workout creation
  - Form filling and validation testing
  - Navigation and UI interaction testing

- **watchOS UI Tests**: `ShuttlXWatchUITests/ShuttlXWatchUITests.swift`
  - Automated sync verification (within 3 seconds)
  - Timer countdown verification (never stuck at 00:00)
  - Workout execution and completion testing

- **Integration Tests**: `Tests/IntegrationTests/ComprehensiveAutomatedIntegrationTests.swift`
  - Complete end-to-end workflow automation
  - Cross-platform data sync verification
  - Timer reliability testing

5. **Timer Testing**: Verifies timer counts down properly (not stuck at 00:00)
6. **Workout Execution**: Tests complete workout flow on watchOS
7. **Data Sync Back**: Verifies completed workout data appears in iOS app

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Run complete automated verification
./build_and_test_both_platforms.sh --full

# üöÄ COMPLETE AUTOMATED WORKFLOW - FULL TESTING PIPELINE
# ‚úÖ PHASE 1 COMPLETE: Both platforms built successfully
# ‚úÖ PHASE 2 COMPLETE: Both apps deployed to simulators
# ‚úÖ PHASE 3 COMPLETE: Automated UI tests finished
# üéâ COMPLETE AUTOMATED WORKFLOW FINISHED!
# Tests123 workflow: ‚úÖ PASSED
# Timer verification: ‚úÖ PASSED
# Sync verification: ‚úÖ PASSED
```
